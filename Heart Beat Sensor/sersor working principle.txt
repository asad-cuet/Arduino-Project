Working of a Heartbeat Sensor
The basic heartbeat sensor consists of a light-emitting diode and a detector like a light detecting resistor or a photodiode.
The heartbeat pulses cause a variation in the flow of blood to different regions of the body.
When tissue is illuminated with the light source, i.e. light emitted by the led, 
it either reflects (a finger tissue) or transmits the light (earlobe). 
Some of the light is absorbed by the blood and the transmitted or the reflected light is received by the light detector. 
The amount of light absorbed depends on the blood volume in that tissue. 
The detector output is in the form of the electrical signal and is proportional to the heartbeat rate.

This signal is a DC signal relating to the tissues and the blood volume and the AC component synchronous with the 
heartbeat and caused by pulsatile changes in arterial blood volume is superimposed on the DC signal. 
Thus the major requirement is to isolate that AC component as it is of prime importance.

HeartbeatTo achieve the task of getting the AC signal, the output from the detector is first filtered 
using a 2 stage HP-LP circuit and is then converted to digital pulses using a comparator circuit or using simple ADC. 
The digital pulses are given to a microcontroller for calculating the heartbeat rate, given by the formula-

BPM(Beats per minute) = 60*f

Where f is the pulse frequency
